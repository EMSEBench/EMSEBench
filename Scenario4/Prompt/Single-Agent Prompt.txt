Suppose you are a software development engineer.In community-based software development, you need to rely on live-chatting transcripts to discuss emergent bugs/errors you encounter in your daily development tasks.

Now you need to classify the sentences I provide you into:observed behaviors (OB), expected behaviors (EB), steps to reproduce the bug (SR) and others.

tips: "_code_" means code snippet, "_eou_" means the end of a sentence and "_version_" means the version number of a app.

Just give your answer, no explanation required.
If you understand everything I said, please answer Understand.Then I would send the content of live-chatting transcripts.

Suppose you are a software development engineer.In community-based software development, you need to rely on live-chatting transcripts to discuss emergent bugs/errors you encounter in your daily development tasks.

Now you need to classify the sentences I provide you into:observed behaviors (OB), expected behaviors (EB), steps to reproduce the bug (SR) and others.

To help you understand these four categories, I will provide you with an example of each category.
There are examples.
"i have added all the required jars in my eclipse project but still i am getting this error. _eou_" observed behaviors (OB)
"when trying to edit or save desired capabilities, _eou_"   expected behaviors (EB)
"i have jdk version _version_  _eou_"  steps to reproduce the bug (SR)
"hi  have a problem with ios 13 device. _eou_"  Others

tips: "_code_" means code snippet, "_eou_" means the end of a sentence and "_version_" means the version number of a app.

Just give your answer, no explanation required.

Title: Classify Sentences from Software Development Live-Chat Transcripts
Task Description:
As a software development engineer, you often rely on live-chat transcripts to discuss and troubleshoot emergent bugs and errors encountered during your development tasks. Your task is to classify the provided sentences from these transcripts into four distinct categories: Observed Behaviors (OB), Expected Behaviors (EB), Steps to Reproduce the Bug (SR), and Other.

Instructions:
Observed Behaviors (OB): Classify sentences that describe actual behaviors or errors experienced. For example: "I have added all the required jars in my Eclipse project but still I am getting this error. eou"
Expected Behaviors (EB): Classify sentences that describe the expected or intended behaviors of the software. For example: "When trying to edit or save desired capabilities, eou"
Steps to Reproduce the Bug (SR): Classify sentences detailing specific steps or conditions needed to replicate the bug. For example: "I have JDK version version eou"
Other: Classify sentences that do not fit into the above categories or are general queries. For example: "Hi, I have a problem with iOS 13 device. eou"

Notes:
"code" represents a code snippet.
"eou" denotes the end of a sentence.
"version" indicates a software version number.

Response Format:
Simply classify each sentence without the need for an explanation.

Confirmation:
If you understand the instructions, please reply with "Understand". Upon confirmation, I will send you the content of the live-chatting transcripts.

Assume the role of a software development engineer. In a community-based software project, you'll use live chat transcripts to analyze and categorize discussions about bugs and errors encountered during daily development.

Your task is to classify the given sentences into four categories:
Observed Behaviors (OB): Descriptions of actual behaviors or issues encountered.
Expected Behaviors (EB): Descriptions of how the software should behave.
Steps to Reproduce the Bug (SR): Instructions on how to replicate the bug or error.
Others: Sentences that don't fall into the above categories.

Here are example sentences for each category:
Observed Behaviors (OB): "I have added all the required jars to my Eclipse project, but I'm still getting this error."
Expected Behaviors (EB): "When trying to edit or save desired capabilities..."
Steps to Reproduce the Bug (SR): "I have JDK version version..."
Others: "Hi, I have a problem with an iOS 13 device."

Note: "code" represents a code snippet, "eou" denotes the end of a sentence, and "version" indicates an app version number.

If you understand the task, simply respond with "Understand." Following this, I will provide you with the live chat transcripts for analysis.

Assuming the role of a software development engineer working in a community-based development environment, I need your assistance classifying sentences from live-chat transcripts into four categories: Observed Behaviors (OB), Expected Behaviors (EB), Steps to Reproduce (SR), and Others.

Here's a breakdown of each category with examples:
Observed Behaviors (OB): Describe what actually happened (e.g., "I added all required jars to my Eclipse project, but I'm still getting this error. eou").
Expected Behaviors (EB): Describe what should have happened (e.g., "When trying to edit or save desired capabilities. eou").
Steps to Reproduce (SR): List steps to consistently trigger the bug (e.g., "I have JDK version version. eou"). This category often includes placeholders like version numbers.
Others: Any sentence not fitting the above categories (e.g., "Hi, having a problem with iOS 13 device. eou").
Please classify the sentences I provide into these categories.

If you understand the task, simply respond with "Understand." Following this, I will provide you with the live chat transcripts for analysis.

You are an AI language model trained to assist software development engineers. Your task is to analyze live-chatting transcripts and classify the sentences provided into four categories:
Observed Behaviors (OB): These are descriptions of what the user is currently experiencing or seeing. It may include error messages, system responses, or any other observable outcomes.
Expected Behaviors (EB): These are descriptions of what the user believes should be happening. It typically involves actions or outcomes that are not occurring as expected.
Steps to Reproduce the Bug (SR): These are specific instructions that, when followed, should lead to the observed behavior. They often include versions of software, environments, or configurations.
Others: This category includes any sentences that do not fall into the above three categories. It could be greetings, non-actionable statements, or off-topic discussions.

To help you understand these categories, here are examples for each:
OB Example: “I have added all the required jars in my Eclipse project, but still, I am getting this error.” (OB)
EB Example: “When trying to edit or save desired capabilities,” (EB)
SR Example: “I have JDK version version.” (SR)
Others Example: “Hi, have a problem with iOS 13 device.” (Others)

Please note the following conventions used in the sentences:
“code” denotes a placeholder for a code snippet.
“eou” denotes the end of a sentence.
“version” denotes a version number of an application or library.
Classify the following sentences into the appropriate categories.
Just give your answer, no explanation required.
