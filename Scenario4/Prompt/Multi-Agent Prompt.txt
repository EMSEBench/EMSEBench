The RaiseGroup team consists of two software development engineers (team members) and one Quality Assurance (QA) engineer (team leader). You are one of the software development engineers, you need to rely on live-chatting transcripts to discuss emergent bugs/errors you encounter in your daily development questions.

Your task now is to categorize the live-chatting transcripts into the following three categories:"observed behaviors"(OB,label 0), "expected behaviors"(EB,label 1), "steps to reproduce the bug"(SR,label 2) and others(O,label 3).

tips: "_code_" means code snippet, "_eou_" means the end of a sentence and "_version_" means the version number of a app.
Give your answer with your reason.

Please note that the other team member will perform the same task independently, and both of your answers and reasons will be submitted to the team leader. If your answers differ from those of the other team member, the team leader will evaluate both sets of answers and reasons, and select the most reasonable one as the final result.  
(This final decision will be communicated to the team member whose answer differs, who may then either modify their answer or choose to keep it.这句话是在第二个模式中才会发送的)

If you understand your role and assignment, please reply with "Understand." After that, you can begin your work.

Currently, the team members are tasked with categorizing the live-chatting transcripts  into three categories:"observed behaviors"(OB,label 0), "expected behaviors"(EB,label 1), "steps to reproduce the bug"(SR,label 2) and others(O,label 3).

tips: "_code_" means code snippet, "_eou_" means the end of a sentence and "_version_" means the version number of a app.

Their answers will be provided in the form of category along with reasons.

Please note that both team members are performing the same task independently, and their answers and reasons will be submitted to you. If both team members provide the same answer, then that answer becomes the final result. If their answers differ, you need to evaluate the answers and reasons from both members and choose the most reasonable one as the final outcome. 
(This result will then be communicated to the team member whose answer differs from the chosen one, who may either change their answer or continue to maintain it.这句话是在第二个模式中才会发送的)

Your answer differed from that of another team member. After the team leader analyzed the answers and reasons of the two team members, the team leader believed that the other team member's answer was more reasonable, and the team leader gave his reasons.
The reasons for the team leader are as follows (you are team member X, and another team member is team member Y):


After understanding the team leader's reasons, you can choose to update your answer, or you can choose to keep your original answer. So now what is your answer to this live-chatting transcript?




The two team members disagreed on the classification of the following live-chatting transcript(separated by ## symbols):
#in the latest version of appium (_version_), i am unable to search an element via ui automator selector (android). _euo_#
Team member 1 thinks:
"Category: Observed behaviors (OB, label 0)
Reasoning: The message describes an observed behavior related to the inability to search an element via UI Automator selector in the latest version of Appium. It provides information about a specific functionality not working as expected, which falls into the category of observed behaviors."

Team member 2 thinks:
"This transcript reports a specific issue encountered with the latest version of Appium, where the user is unable to search for an element via UI Automator selector on Android. It details a problem with expected behavior, as the user is unable to perform a specific action that should be possible. Therefore, I would categorize this as "expected behaviors" (EB, label 1)."
Please choose the one you think is the most reasonable based on the reasons given by the two team members as the final answer.
