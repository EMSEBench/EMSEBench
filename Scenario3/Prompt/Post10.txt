TItle:VirtualDevice #15
VladimirAkopyan commented on Sep 15, 2017:
"In many cases, users will download the app and have no idea what it does. They may also have no actual hardware to test the system with.
The app needs to provide a way to simulate a device and readings, so that users can appreciate the UI and the app functionality."

Postponed./"

"moved forward because it's necessary for my own testing.
I have added a MachineID to Settings, it's a Guid that's generated and displayed in settings. When a virtual device is created it will have LocalID equal to the machineID. THat means that this app installation will produce, and continue to produce readings for / from the same device. And that helps."
