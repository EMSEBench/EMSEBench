Suppose you are an IoT Quality Assurance Analyst.
Now your tasks are: 1. Learn the IoT engineering bug categories I provide you; 2. Read the text-form posts I provide you and classify the IoT engineering bugs mentioned in the posts.

First, I will introduce you to the categories and theri subcategories of IoT engineering bugs.I will use double quotes "" to indicate the main category, single quotes '' to indicate the subcategory.

"IoT Device". This category of taxonomy covers bugs that are related to IoT device hardware and firmware:
#'Device hardware':Bugs in this subcategory are related to the physical aspects of IoT devices.Such as Issues related to constraints of devices and Boot/reboot or physical issues.
#'Device firmware': Such as Firmware exception/hang issues , Configuration issues and Firmware update issues.

"Compatibility". When a bug occurs only on a specific type of device, communication protocol, or third-party component, it falls under the compatibility category.Such as Device compatibility issues ,Protocol compatibility issues and Third-party compatibility issues.

"Communication with IoT devices". Bugs that are related to the communication of IoT devices with each other or with other entities fall under this category. Generally, there are two types of bugs in this category:
#'Device Connectivity':Some of the connectivity issues are related to the network that the device relies on for connecting to the internet. Such as Network discovery and set-up issues, Network reset/mode change and Unreliable network , three related to 'Network'.And last three are Connection establishment issues, Reconnection issues and Disconnection issues.
#'Data and Messaging':This category includes bugs that are related to data and message sending in the IoT system.Such as Message Payload issues, Message timing/rate/
ordering issues and Message delivery issues.

"Cloud/Edge Services". This category includes bugs that are related to the services delivered by the remote cloud servers or gateway devices in the edge layer:
#'Device Management':
The first class of DM issues happens in the stage of initializing the IoT device in the cloud or edge systems.Such as Device discovery and identification issues, Device registration and provisioning issues and Device binding/association/ pairing issues.
The second class of DM issues is related to problems with monitoring the status of IoT devices.Such as Device connection status issues and Device properties status issues.

#'Automation': This bug category is related to automation services that IoT cloud or edge platforms provide and it is classified into the trigger, condition, and execution issues.Such as Rule trigger issues, Rule condition issues and Rule action execution issues.

"General Development". This category captures common development bugs. Some common issues are problems with installing, compiling, or building a project as well as unexpected crashes or performance issues in the IoT project. The general development category also includes bugs in the authentication or authorization process. Such as Auth issues,UI/usability issues, performance/crash issue,Third-party issues and Build and installation issues.

By now I believe you are familiar with the categories of IoT engineering bugs. Next, I will provide you with a post in text form. Please read the content of the post carefully and classify the IoT engineering bugs involved in the post.

Your answer must be a category in double quotes "".No need to specific to subcategory.Just give your answer, no explanation required.

If you understand everything I said, please answer Understand. Then I will send the content of the post.

Suppose you are an IoT Quality Assurance Analyst. Your task is to classify bugs mentioned in text posts based on the categories I provide.

Here's a classification system for IoT engineering bugs:

Main Categories (bolded): These are broad groups of bugs. I will use double quotes ("") to indicate them.
Subcategories (single quotes): These are more specific types of bugs within a main category. I will use single quotes ('') to indicate them.
The five main categories are:

"IoT Device": Bugs related to device hardware and firmware (e.g., 'Device hardware': issues with physical aspects, 'Device firmware': issues with firmware).
"Compatibility": Bugs related to specific devices, protocols, or third-party components not working together.
"Communication with IoT devices": Bugs related to communication between devices or with other systems (e.g., 'Device Connectivity': network issues, 'Data and Messaging': issues with data transmission).
"Cloud/Edge Services": Bugs related to cloud or edge services (e.g., 'Device Management': issues with managing devices, 'Automation': issues with automated tasks).
"General Development": Common development bugs (e.g., authentication issues, performance issues).
Once you understand these categories, respond with 'Confirmed.' Then, I will provide example posts for each category.
