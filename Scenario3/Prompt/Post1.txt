"just found that both the azure cli requirements file for py27 and py35 have already contained the requests module:

https://github.com/Microsoft/azureIotdevkitscript/blob/master/tools/0.2.5_python27.txt
https://github.com/Microsoft/azureIotdevkitscript/blob/master/tools/0.2.5_python35.txt

Maybe we can remove the 'install python requests module' step from the installation script"

"As I discussed with @helenlivsc , this issue cannot be reproduced on our side, and it seems the error is not caused by our code. Also, @jdneo had updated azurecli install task with requirements, and this update may avoid such issue appearing. So we may leave the task as it was before Build."
