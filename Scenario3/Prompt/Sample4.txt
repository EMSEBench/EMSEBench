Norien commented on Apr 27, 2017:
"sometimes TTS and Notify both trigger that the wash is completed after a restart."

Norien commented on May 1, 2017:
"Automation determined wash was done and shut switch off however wash was not completed 12 mins had remained.

Maybe add a condition for the value to stay for 3 mins"

Norien commented on May 2, 2017:
"Added a condition to only trigger if the state stays 4.2 for 3 mins"
