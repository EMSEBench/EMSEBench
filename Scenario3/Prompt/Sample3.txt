Title:Agent type system relies on the fact that uint32_t is identical to unsigned int #556

"Agent type system relies on the fact that uint32_t is identical to unsigned int. On the system I'm trying to compile it for they are of similar size. The compiler doesn't like it though, as it feels the types are not the same, and compilation fails.

"Hi @k2nsloos ,
what is the platform you are building for? (OS, compiler and versions?)
Also, what is the version of the SDK you are trying to compile?"

I'm compiling for cortex-m3 / armv7-m

"Hi @k2nsloos ,
a fix was just checked into master branch to explicitly cast the value.
Could please you verify it addresses the failure you experienced?"
