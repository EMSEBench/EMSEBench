Title:keras custom loss convert to coreml
JACKYLUO1991 commented on Jun 27, 2018
I use
def matting_loss(x):

def loss(y_true, y_pred):

    La = dice_coef_loss(y_true, y_pred)

    mul_true = K.concatenate([y_true, y_true, y_true], axis=-1) * x

    mul_pred = K.concatenate([y_pred, y_pred, y_pred], axis=-1) * x

    Lcolor = K.mean(K.sqrt(K.square(mul_true - mul_pred) + K.epsilon()))

    return La + 0.5 * Lcolor

return loss
in keras, but cannot convet it to coreml, anyone who can help me!!!

Since CoreML is only for inference there is no concept of loss functions.
Why do you need a loss function for inference?
