Demo is available by Tensorflow in following link :
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/java/demo

Please change labels.txt file in above file by adding or removing a text(class) , It'll crash the application.
It's making the given solution unable to change output's size.
Please address the solution, how can we change the label.txt file with some constants like INPUT_SIZE or OUTPUT_SIZE that makes this bug solved.

Note

Application works fine as it is, but crash upon changing label.txt file, e.g. adding or removing names in the file.

Crash :

Cannot copy between a TensorFlowLite tensor with shape [1, 1001] and a Java object with shape [1, 1000].
**Above demo is build by using already present gradle configuration setting.

Feature request:
Changing label file size & work accordingly through parameter is available in IOS demo with this
output_size = 1000;
This feature should be in Android version as well.

Thanks.

shahid14 commented on Dec 7, 2018:
I think it's not possible to do it, but if it's done on IOS side it should be available in Android as well.

jdduke commented on Dec 8, 2018:
The labels length needs to match the output tensor length for your trained model. You cannot simply resize your labels file and expect it to work with the same source model; the two are coupled. Of course, you can hardcode an override in your own code if you wish, but that's not generally desirable.

@jdduke I h'v resolved the problem myself:

Problem :

Cannot copy between a TensorFlowLite tensor with shape ...

Solution :

Changes to TFLiteImageClassifier file in Tensoflow/lite/examples/android are following:

It's great to resize the input tensors, as this functionality is provided by Tensorflow-lite but
It should be used carefully, Like there would be a lot of problems coming on the way, but you got to look into buffers(imgData) and

Changing labels types to following line.

private List labels = new ArrayList();

Biggest change in TFLiteImageClassifier is:

c.tfLite = new Interpreter(c.loadModelFile(assetManager, modelFilename));

  int[] dimensions = new int[4];
  dimensions[0] = 1; // Batch_size // No of frames at a time
  dimensions[1] = 224; // Image Width required by model
  dimensions[2] = 224; // Image Height required by model
  dimensions[3] = 3; // No of Pixels
  Tensor tensor = c.tfLite.getInputTensor(0);
  c.tfLite.resizeInput(0, dimensions);
  Tensor tensor1 = c.tfLite.getInputTensor(0);
Placing above code in TFLiteImageClassifier would resize your input tensors, so your model can take images of any size, pixels or batches.

So even if your model is accepting 150*150 images, or h'v other different parameters, you can make your model accept this size of images, to improve your model accuracy.

Request :
So far, I h'v came to know that output tensors are also resize-able in IOS demo version, but In case of Android demo version it's not mentioned anywhere in given demo in Tensorflow lite Android version, Hopefully I would find a way to do it as well soon.

Suggestion :
Tensorflow lite Android version resizing input tensors link were not given anywhere properly or in demo code, took me a little longer to resolve this issue, Please update Read me & code as well.

Thanks All.

jdduke commented on Dec 18, 2018:
Thanks for the report, @shahid14. We do have an example which resizes the input tensor, but it's not at all prominent. We'll also be publishing proper API documentation in the coming month, so look out for that as well. Cheers!

Hie shahid14 ,

Your suggestion looks good.
I have trained my custom object detector using tensorflow 1.8.0 and 1.13.1.
I converted the model to tflite using tflite_convert and then trying to deploy in the android project. It is throwing the error "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot convert between a TensorFlowLite buffer with 1080000 bytes and a ByteBuffer with 270000 bytes."
Can you please suggest me something doing which I will be able to build my detector in android.

Thank you
Rashmi

Hi Rashmi,
The issue you are facing can be solved by playing with nuts & bolts in your code.
You can also get help from the following issue:
#14719

ava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot convert between a TensorFlowLite buffer with 1080000 bytes and a ByteBuffer with 270000 bytes."

hamlatzis commented on Oct 8, 2019:
I'm not sure if I have a similar or related problem. I am interested in modifying the batch size and I can resize the input tensors, but when I call to allocate the tensors I get an error message

tensorflow/lite/kernels/reshape.cc:58 num_input_elements != num_output_elements (6 != 30)Node number 228

I am unable to find which operation (built-in or custom) has the batch size as constant

nhnam commented on Oct 11, 2019:
same problem here !!!!

jdduke commented on Oct 12, 2019:
@hamlatzis can you file a separate bug for that issue, ideally with a link to your converted model (and/or the source model, including how you converted it)? Thanks.

hamlatzis commented on Oct 15, 2019:
@jdduke regarding #23940 (comment) I've asked my manager regarding your request and I'm waiting for his reply.

In the mean time I see there is a similar open issue #22377

Also I've found at stackoveflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50735705/tensorflow-litetflite-invoke-error-after-resize-the-input-dimension)
