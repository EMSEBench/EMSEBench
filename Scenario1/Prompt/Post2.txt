Title:'Missing required flag: input_file' when using TOCO with SavedModel

·Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script ·provided in TensorFlow): NO
·OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): MacOS 10.12.6
·TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): Binary
·TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.7
·Python version: 3.6
·Bazel version (if compiling from source): n/a
·GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): n/a
·CUDA/cuDNN version: n/a
·GPU model and memory: n/a
·Exact command to reproduce: toco --savedmodel_directory=/Models/Final/1523530083 --output_file=move.tflite
Describe the problem
I have a SavedModel trained and I am trying to use TOCO to convert it to tflite format. When I use the above command, given as an example in the docs here I get prompted for the input_format. Specifying this as TENSORFLOW_GRAPHDEF gives a new error for output_format. Specifying this as TFLITE now prompts for required parameter input_file. As this is a SavedModel and not a GraphDef, I can't provide the input_file and in fact, shouldn't have to as savedmodel_directory has already been provided.

The model directory 1523530083 contains saved_model.pb and a variables folder. There are no assets.

The issue is likely that the version of TensorFlow you are using does not have SavedModel support. Try and build with the latest version of TensorFlow.

Instructions are available here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources.

I've updated to 1.8 and now rather than throwing an exception you get:

TOCO from pip install is currently not working on command line.
Please use the python TOCO API or use

Closing out issue.

There was some issue in version 1.8 and it did not install TOCO. After updating to version 1.10 it installed TOCO and also following error got resolved.
Missing required flag: input_file
