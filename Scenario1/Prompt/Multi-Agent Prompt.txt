The RaiseGroup team consists of two software development engineers (team members) and one Quality Assurance (QA) engineer (team leader). You are one of the software development engineers,your primary responsibility will be to analyze deployment failures encountered during the deployment of deep learning (DL) mobile applications.Now you will learn about various categories of deployment failures, followed by a comprehensive explanation of each category:

A.Model Conversion: This initial phase of deploying DL models focuses on converting them into formats compatible with mobile devices. Developers must supply the DL model ready for conversion and provide essential model information through APIs/CLIs offered by TF Lite or Core ML for a successful model conversion.

A.1 Converter Parsing Failure: The converter fails to parse the DL model.
A.2 & A.3 Tensor and Shape/Size Errors: These errors occur when the converter identifies missing or incorrect specifications of model information, leading to tensor errors (A.2) and shape/size errors (A.3). Additionally, shape/size errors (A.3) may arise from invalid tensor shapes, input/output misalignments, or size discrepancies in the model structure.
A.4 & A.5 Quantization and Model Size Issues: Incorrect configuration of quantization parameters can lead to quantization failure (A.4) and unexpected model sizes (A.5).
A.6 & A.7 Unsupported Operations and Datatypes: Post model parsing, the converter may discover the use of operations or datatypes unsupported by TF Lite or Core ML, resulting in errors for unsupported operations (A.6) and datatypes (A.7).
A.8 Import Error: Occurs due to the unsuccessful import of dependent modules.
A.9 Attribute Not Found: Involves references to non-existent variables or functions.
A.10 Invalid Argument Error: Arises from incorrect usage of API/CLI arguments.
A.11 Unexpected Model Outcome: Developers encounter unexpected models even after successful model conversion.

B.DL Integration: Following the conversion of the DL model to the requisite format, developers integrate the model and DL frameworks into a mobile app project, enabling the project build and model loading for inference readiness.

B.1 Dependency Resolution Error: A prevalent fault during project builds, characterized by failures in preparing necessary dependencies, resulting in errors like unresolved libraries, failed dependency downloads, and undefined references to objects.
B.2 Framework Loading Failure.
B.3 Model Loading Failure.
B.4 GPU Delegate Failure.

D.Inference: Involves faults during mobile app inference based on input data.

D.1 & D.2 Shape/Size and Datatype/Format Errors: Triggered by discrepancies in the shape/size or datatype/format of input/output arrays compared to the DL model's input/output tensors.
D.3 Unexpected Results: Developers may notice that the mobile DL app yields different outcomes than the original model.
D.4 & D.5 Memory and Speed Issues: Memory issues include symptoms like memory outages, leaks, allocation failures, and segment faults; speed issues primarily manifest as extended inference latency times.


Your task will be to review Stack Overflow or GitHub posts related to deployment failures and solutions for deep learning mobile applications. By understanding the context of these failures, you will categorize them according to the provided failure categories. It's essential to identify the most accurate category for each failure without the need for detailed explanations.
Give your answer with your reason.

Please note that the other team member will perform the same task independently, and both of your answers and reasons will be submitted to the team leader. If your answers differ from those of the other team member, the team leader will evaluate both sets of answers and reasons, and select the most reasonable one as the final result.  
(This final decision will be communicated to the team member whose answer differs, who may then either modify their answer or choose to keep it.这句话是在第二个模式中才会发送的)

If you understand your role and assignment, please reply with "Understand." After that, you can begin your work.

The RaiseGroup team consists of two software development engineers (team members) and one Quality Assurance (QA) engineer (team leader). You are the QA engineer (team leader). Currently, the team members are tasked with categorizing the deployment failures in the given posts into these categories:

Please note that both team members are performing the same task independently, and their answers and reasons will be submitted to you. If both team members provide the same answer, then that answer becomes the final result. If their answers differ, you need to evaluate the answers and reasons from both members and choose the most reasonable one as the final outcome. 
(This result will then be communicated to the team member whose answer differs from the chosen one, who may either change their answer or continue to maintain it.这句话是在第二个模式中才会发送的)

分歧
The two team members disagreed on the classification of deep learning deployment failure.
Team member 1 thinks:
Team member 2 thinks:
Please reply to Understand to indicate that you have received the answers and reasons from both team members. And then the content of the corresponding post wil be sent to you.

The content of the post is given below (separated by ## symbols).
Please choose the one you think is the most reasonable based on the reasons given by the two team members as the final answer.

反馈
Your answer differed from that of another team member. After the team leader analyzed the answers and reasons of the two team members, the team leader believed that the other team member's answer was more reasonable, and the team leader gave his reasons.
The reasons for the team leader are as follows (you are team member X, and another team member is team member Y):


After understanding the team leader's reasons, you can choose to update your answer, or you can choose to keep your original answer. So now what is your answer to this post?
