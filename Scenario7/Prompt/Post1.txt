Comment:['@josephrocca thanks for reporting ; I see there is a older copy on npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs-tflite/v/0.0.1-alpha.2) ; @jinjingforever do we need to push latest to npm ?====='; 'Nice catch @josephrocca! I think the order is wrong in the README file; (tfjs-core should be before tfjs-backend-cpi); also the tfjs-tflite import is also wrong:) I will send a PR to fix this. Thank you! ====='; 'I just realized that we do have the correct instructions in the README file in the master branch. I will publish a new version to npm soon (maybe in the next 1-2 weeks). Thank you! Closing this issue for now.====='; 'Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaP12TRhd9xSxjXZjcZFNXPGk4kc1-qMdv3gc6bEP90vY1ew/viewform?entry.85265664=Yes&entry.2137816233=https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/5530">Yes</a><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaP12TRhd9xSxjXZjcZFNXPGk4kc1-qMdv3gc6bEP90vY1ew/viewform?entry.85265664=No&entry.2137816233=https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/5530">No</a>====='; "@jinjingforever Ah; cool; thanks! Also; can I unrelatedly suggest that you add an initial console warning if people are using a script tag linked to the latest version? Perhaps by just checking `document.currentScript.src` for a version string (if the runtime has the `document` global). Either that; or use versioned links in the readme? That prevents newbies (who don't realise the problem with using the link straight from the readme) from having their app break when there's a breaking change in tfjs.====="; 'Good ideas! Thanks @josephrocca. Will update README with versioned links for now. =====']
