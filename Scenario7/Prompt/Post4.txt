Comment:['Hi Kay;I haven\'t set up Android emulator on my machine; but for the web; I actually encountered the same issue. It is fixed by the steps below:- Run: `expo customize:web`  - Use the space key to select the `webpack.config.js` entry; then press "enter"  - This will create a bare-minimum `webpack.config.js` file.- Edit the `webpack.config.js` file to make webpack transpile all `@tensorflow` packages. Here is what my file looks like```const createExpoWebpackConfigAsync = require(\'@expo/webpack-config\');module.exports = async function(env; argv) {  const config = await createExpoWebpackConfigAsync(      {        ...env;        babel: {          dangerouslyAddModulePathsToTranspile: [            // Ensure that all packages starting with @tensorflow are            // transpiled.            \'@tensorflow\';          ];        };      };      argv);  return config;};``` - Now `npm run web` should workPlease check if this helps with the Android build as well. Thanks!====='; "@jinjingforever Hey;I followed your steps and got `npm run web` working. Is this some extra setup step that needs to now be added to the readme?The `npm run android` still does not work for another reason which i'll make a new issue for when i revist it.====="; 'Are you satisfied with the resolution of your issue?<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaP12TRhd9xSxjXZjcZFNXPGk4kc1-qMdv3gc6bEP90vY1ew/viewform?entry.85265664=Yes&entry.2137816233=https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/4803">Yes</a><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaP12TRhd9xSxjXZjcZFNXPGk4kc1-qMdv3gc6bEP90vY1ew/viewform?entry.85265664=No&entry.2137816233=https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues/4803">No</a>=====']
