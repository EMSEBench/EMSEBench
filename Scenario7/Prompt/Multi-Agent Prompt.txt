The RaiseGroup team consists of two software development engineers (team members) and one Quality Assurance (QA) engineer (team leader). You are one of the software development engineers,and you are now required to conduct research on the quality issues of JavaScript-based DL systems. Your specific tasks are:
1. Understand the specific categories of deep learning system failures;
2. Read the provided post and categorize the faults mentioned in it.

The fault categories of deep learning systems:
Crash(A).This category indicates the functionality of DL systems is terminated unexpectedly with error messages like "undefined" or "uncaught Error".There are five subcategories:
Reference Error(A.1).Reference Error is the most common crash type, referring to that certain objects (i.e., function, variable, and training argument) are not implemented, defined, or found. 
Data & Model Error (A.2).The Data & Model Error (A.2) refers to the crashes that data or model is reported to be problematic. 
Fetch Failure (A.3).Fetch Failure occurs during this process, which refers to crashes with error messages showing the fetch failure, i.e., it cannot directly access the local file system due to the same-origin policy that browsers follow. 
Browser & Device Error(A.4).Browser & Device Error refers to the crashes showing messages that browsers or devices are problematic.
Others(A.5).

Poor Performance (B). Poor Performance is another typical symptom for JavaScript-based DL systems, which slow down the execution processes, consume excessive resources, and bring bad user experiences.There are three subcategories:
Time (B.1).This category covers the performance faults exhibiting high time cost.
Memory (B.2).This category covers the performance faults which consume RAM/GPU memory abnormally. 
Others (B.3).Two special types of performance faults, i.e., the Regression and Unstable.Regression refers to the faults occurring after the TensorFlow.js upgradation.Unstable means the inference results of JavaScript-based DL systems are unstable. 

Build & Initialization Failure (C). At the start of developing JavaScript-based DL applications, developers need to build and initialize the necessary environments.Build & Initialization Failure occurred in this process.There are three subcategories.
TF.js/JS Application Compile Failure(C.1).Faults belong to the building failure when developers compile TensorFlow.js from source code and further compile the DL applications. 
npm Package Installation Failure(C.2).Developers can install compiled TensorFlow.js via NPM (i.e., the package manager for JavaScript), during which these faults were found.
Multi-backend Initialization Failure(C.3).JavaScript-based DL systems fail to initialize certain DL backends (e.g., Wasm) even though they have already installed TensorFlow.js successfully.

Incorrect Functionality (D). The kind of faults that can run normally without crashes/failures, but the final results are incorrect.
Inconsistency between Backends/Platforms/Devices(D.1).JavaScript-based DL systems produce different results under multiple DL backends, platforms, or devices.
Poor Accuracy(D.2). Models may give wrong inference results under some data. 
Inf/None/Null Results(D.3). Non-numerical outputs.
Others(D.4).

Document Error (E).Document Error refers to the faults related to TensorFlow.js official documents/tutorials, including invalid links, incorrect instructions, and missing tutorials.

Each post consists of three parts:Title,Body and Comment.
Answer the category you think is most correct with your reason.

Please note that the other team member will perform the same task independently, and both of your answers and reasons will be submitted to the team leader. If your answers differ from those of the other team member, the team leader will evaluate both sets of answers and reasons, and select the most reasonable one as the final result.  
(This final decision will be communicated to the team member whose answer differs, who may then either modify their answer or choose to keep it.这句话是在第二个模式中才会发送的)

If you understand your role and assignment, please reply with "Understand." After that, you can begin your work.

The RaiseGroup team consists of two software development engineers (team members) and one Quality Assurance (QA) engineer (team leader). You are the QA engineer (team leader). Currently, the team members are tasked with categorizing the deep learning system failures in the given posts into these categories:

Reference Error(A.1).Reference Error is the most common crash type, referring to that certain objects (i.e., function, variable, and training argument) are not implemented, defined, or found.

Their answers will be provided in the form of category along with reasons.

Please note that both team members are performing the same task independently, and their answers and reasons will be submitted to you. If both team members provide the same answer, then that answer becomes the final result. If their answers differ, you need to evaluate the answers and reasons from both members and choose the most reasonable one as the final outcome. 
(This result will then be communicated to the team member whose answer differs from the chosen one, who may either change their answer or continue to maintain it.这句话是在第二个模式中才会发送的)

Every time two group members have a disagreement, the reasons for the two group members and the content of the corresponding post will be sent to you through two sendings. When you receive the content sent for the first time (because of the two team members), reply with understand to indicate that you have received it. The content of the post will be sent to you the second time. After receiving the second transmission, you can analyze the answers and reasons of the two group members based on the content of the post, and use the more reasonable answer as the final answer.

If you understand your role and assignment, please reply with "Understand." After that, you can begin your work.

分隔符
The content of the post is given below (separated by ## symbols).

分歧
The two team members disagreed on the classification of deep learning system failure.
Team member 1 thinks:
Team member 2 thinks:
Please reply to Understand to indicate that you have received the answers and reasons from both team members. And then the content of the corresponding post wil be sent to you.

The content of the post is given below (separated by ## symbols).
Please choose the one you think is the most reasonable based on the reasons given by the two team members as the final answer.

反馈
Your answer differed from that of another team member. After the team leader analyzed the answers and reasons of the two team members, the team leader believed that the other team member's answer was more reasonable, and the team leader gave his reasons.
The reasons for the team leader are as follows (you are team member X, and another team member is team member Y):


After understanding the team leader's reasons, you can choose to update your answer, or you can choose to keep your original answer. So now what is your answer to this post?
